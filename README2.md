## My process
Built for desktop forst but realized ad often adviced; it's better to build for mobile first. So I stopped the desktop codes from running and did for mobile and that's it.
project took less than an hour total.

### What I learned

Always build for mobile first on projects like this. I wrote the code for desktop first and when I was writing for mobile, I expected the screen to automatically adjust after<br>
media query. But nope, I had to stop the desktop codes from running while I built for mobile. I also learned the img element is useful for placing images in divs and sizing them.
